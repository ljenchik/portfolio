      <p>
        I am an experienced maths teacher, a career dswitcher and
        a mother of two boys{" "}

      <p>
        {" "}
        During the pandemic and while on childcare leave, I decided to try
        something different in terms of my career. I started with basic online
        Python courses on Coursera which I found interesting and motivating. I
        felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment from completing challenging
        coding tasks, and so I decided to continue learning to programme and
        make it my future profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went on to complete the EPAM Python Online UA course, the TechSwitch
        retraining program and the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from the above I love learning and want to continue to
        grasp new skills and ideas. I want to help other people through
        developing software, and I would like to have a creative, challenging,
        and flexible job which offers career development. I am full of
        enthusiasm and ready for the challenges.
